/**
 * \brief Perform code completion at a given location in a translation unit.
 *
 * This function performs code completion at a particular file, line, and
 * column within source code, providing results that suggest potential
 * code snippets based on the context of the completion. The basic model
 * for code completion is that Clang will parse a complete source file,
 * performing syntax checking up to the location where code-completion has
 * been requested. At that point, a special code-completion token is passed
 * to the parser, which recognizes this token and determines, based on the
 * current location in the C/Objective-C/C++ grammar and the state of
 * semantic analysis, what completions to provide. These completions are
 * returned via a new \c CXCodeCompleteResults structure.
 *
 * Code completion itself is meant to be triggered by the client when the
 * user types punctuation characters or whitespace, at which point the
 * code-completion location will coincide with the cursor. For example, if \c p
 * is a pointer, code-completion might be triggered after the "-" and then
 * after the ">" in \c p->. When the code-completion location is afer the ">",
 * the completion results will provide, e.g., the members of the struct that
 * "p" points to. The client is responsible for placing the cursor at the
 * beginning of the token currently being typed, then filtering the results
 * based on the contents of the token. For example, when code-completing for
 * the expression \c p->get, the client should provide the location just after
 * the ">" (e.g., pointing at the "g") to this code-completion hook. Then, the
 * client can filter the results based on the current token text ("get"), only
 * showing those results that start with "get". The intent of this interface
 * is to separate the relatively high-latency acquisition of code-completion
 * results from the filtering of results on a per-character basis, which must
 * have a lower latency.
 *
 * \param TU The translation unit in which code-completion should
 * occur. The source files for this translation unit need not be
 * completely up-to-date (and the contents of those source files may
 * be overridden via \p unsaved_files). Cursors referring into the
 * translation unit may be invalidated by this invocation.
 *
 * \param complete_filename The name of the source file where code
 * completion should be performed. This filename may be any file
 * included in the translation unit.
 *
 * \param complete_line The line at which code-completion should occur.
 *
 * \param complete_column The column at which code-completion should occur.
 * Note that the column should point just after the syntactic construct that
 * initiated code completion, and not in the middle of a lexical token.
 *
 * \param unsaved_files the Tiles that have not yet been saved to disk
 * but may be required for parsing or code completion, including the
 * contents of those files.  The contents and name of these files (as
 * specified by CXUnsavedFile) are copied when necessary, so the
 * client only needs to guarantee their validity until the call to
 * this function returns.
 *
 * \param num_unsaved_files The number of unsaved file entries in \p
 * unsaved_files.
 *
 * \param options Extra options that control the behavior of code
 * completion, expressed as a bitwise OR of the enumerators of the
 * CXCodeComplete_Flags enumeration. The
 * \c clang_defaultCodeCompleteOptions() function returns a default set
 * of code-completion options.
 *
 * \returns If successful, a new \c CXCodeCompleteResults structure
 * containing code-completion results, which should eventually be
 * freed with \c clang_disposeCodeCompleteResults(). If code
 * completion fails, returns NULL.
